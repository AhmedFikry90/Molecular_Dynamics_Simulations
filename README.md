The MD simulation workflow I've created provides a comprehensive framework for running molecular dynamics simulations with support for multiple popular MD engines. 



The modular design allows for easy extension and customization while providing robust error handling and detailed logging throughout the simulation process.

The workflow handles each stage of the MD simulation process - from structure preparation through parameterization, system setup, energy minimization, equilibration, production runs, and analysis - all managed through a convenient command-line interface. Each module operates independently while maintaining data flow between stages, and the system includes automatic dependency checking to ensure all required software is available.

The workflow is especially designed to be compatible with HPC environments through integrated job script generation and submission capabilities for different schedulers (SLURM, PBS, SGE). It also provides detailed reporting and analysis of simulation results, generating both data files and summary reports to help interpret the outcomes of your simulations.
